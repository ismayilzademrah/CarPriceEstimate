Car Price Estimate App

Welcome to the Car Price Estimate App! 
This project leverages various machine learning models to predict car prices based on several features. The app is built using Streamlit, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface.


Features:

Interactive Interface: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction.

Robust Model Implementation: Uses advanced algorithms like XGBoost, CatBoost, LGBM, and RandomForest.

In-Depth Analysis: Thorough evaluation of each model’s performance.

Stacking Regressor: Combines multiple models with CatBoost as the meta learner for enhanced performance.


Models Used:

XGBoost, CatBoost, LGBM (LightGBM), RandomForest. The final model is a Stacking Regressor with CatBoost as the meta learner and the other models as base learners.
